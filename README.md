# Enterprise AI — Agentic Platform

![Enterprise AI Intelligence Team](enterprise-ai.png)

Enterprise AI is an agentic platform for regulated financial-services workflows. It combines:

- Secure agent services built with LangGraph and FastAPI
- MCP tool servers for CRM, payments, news, and SQL access
- A shared `platform-sdk` for auth, policy enforcement, caching, logging, and telemetry
- A local Docker stack for development, testing, and demos

This repository currently includes:

- `ai-agents`: a generic chat agent backed by a secure SQL MCP server
- `chat-ui`: a Chainlit frontend for the generic chat agent
- `analytics-agent`: analytics and insights agent backed by secure data sources
- `analytics-dashboard`: dashboarding and visualization frontend

### MCP tool servers

| MCP server | Purpose | Default local URL |
|---|---|---|
| `data-mcp` | Secure read-only SQL for the generic agent | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `salesforce-mcp` | CRM account summary and relationship context | `http://localhost:8081` |

| `news-search-mcp` | Company news via Tavily or mock data | `http://localhost:8083` |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.11+
- Make
- OPA CLI

Example install commands:

```bash
# macOS
brew install python@3.11 opa

# Linux / WSL
sudo apt install python3-full make
curl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.65.0/opa_linux_amd64_static
chmod +x opa
sudo mv opa /usr/local/bin/opa
```

### 1. Create local config

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in at least these values in `.env`:

- `AZURE_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_API_BASE`
- `INTERNAL_API_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `CONTEXT_HMAC_SECRET`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`

Generate the secrets with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print('sk-ent-' + secrets.token_hex(24))"
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### 2. Install the shared SDK locally

```bash
make sdk-install
```

This creates `.venv/` and installs `platform-sdk` in editable mode.

### 3. Start infrastructure (once)

```bash
make infra-test-up
```

This starts the long-lived infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, LiteLLM, LangFuse, OPA, OTel) with test data. You only need to run this once — infrastructure survives across `dev-reset` cycles.

### 4. Start application services

```bash
make dev-test-up
```

This builds and starts agents, MCP tools, and frontends. Use `make dev-up` instead if you don't need CRM/payments test fixtures.

### 5. Watch logs if something looks stuck

```bash
make dev-logs       # app service logs
make infra-logs     # infrastructure logs
```

## Verify It Works

### Generic chat path

1. Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
2. Sign in with any username in local development
3. Send a prompt that requires SQL-backed reasoning

### Health checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8005/health
```

## How It Works

### High-level architecture

```text
Browser / API Client
  └─> API Gateway  (Kong · Auth0 JWT · OPA tool_auth)
        └─> Orchestrator Agent  (LangGraph StateGraph / ReAct)
              ├─> Specialist Agent Node: gather_crm
              │     └─> salesforce-mcp  ->  Salesforce CRM
              ├─> Specialist Agent Node: gather_payments
              │     └─> payments-mcp   ->  Payments API
              ├─> Specialist Agent Node: gather_news
              │     └─> news-search-mcp -> News Search API
              └─> Specialist Agent Node: gather_data
                    └─> data-mcp        ->  PostgreSQL (row-filtered, column-masked)

Cross-cutting concerns (applied at every layer)
  └─> platform-sdk   — AgentContext propagation, OPA checks, cache helpers, telemetry
  └─> OPA            — fail-closed policy evaluation (authz.rego)
  └─> Redis          — tool-result cache, rate-limit counters, session state
  └─> OpenTelemetry  — distributed traces and spans → OTel Collector → LangFuse / Datadog / etc.
```

Orchestrator agents own the workflow and routing logic. They never call data sources directly — they delegate to specialist nodes, each of which calls a single MCP tool server. MCP servers enforce row-level restrictions, column masking, and audit boundaries before touching any backend.

### Core design ideas

#### 1. Shared platform SDK

The `platform-sdk/` package centralizes cross-cutting behavior so every service uses the same patterns for:

- API key verification and HMAC-signed `AgentContext` propagation
- OPA authorization (fail-closed, with `CircuitBreaker` resilience)
- Redis-backed tool-result caching (also circuit-breaker protected)
- Sandboxed prompt loading via `PromptLoader` (prevents SSTI attacks)
- Structured JSON logging and OpenTelemetry tracing
- Typed configuration via `AgentConfig` and `MCPConfig`
- `make_checkpointer()` factory for MemorySaver or AsyncPostgresSaver selection
- Dependency injection protocols (`Authorizer`, `CacheStore`, `LLMClient`, `ToolBridge`, `PortfolioDataSource`)

This keeps service code focused on business logic instead of repeating infrastructure code.

#### 2. MCP for data access

Each data source is wrapped as an MCP server. Agents do not talk directly to CRM or payments databases. Instead they call MCP tools that enforce:

- tool-level authorization
- row-level restrictions
- column masking
- cache policy
- traceable request boundaries

#### 3. Policy as code with OPA

Authorization is delegated to Open Policy Agent rather than embedded ad hoc in service code. That gives you:

- version-controlled policy
- repeatable tests
- a single place to review authorization logic

#### 4. Different agent patterns for different jobs

All agents follow a two-tier pattern: an **orchestrator** drives the workflow, and **specialist nodes** handle focused data-retrieval tasks. Specialist nodes call MCP tools — they never skip that layer to reach databases or APIs directly.

| Agent | Orchestrator pattern | Specialist nodes | MCP tools called |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ai-agents` | ReAct tool-call loop | Single node per tool call | `data-mcp` |
| `analytics-agent` | ReAct tool-call loop | Single node per tool call | `data-mcp` |

### Security model

Authentication and authorization flow:

1. The API boundary authenticates the caller
2. The agent builds an `AgentContext`
3. That context is signed and forwarded as `X-Agent-Context`
4. MCP servers verify the signature
5. OPA decides whether the tool call is allowed
6. Row filters and column masks are applied before data is returned

This avoids forwarding raw user JWTs to every downstream service.

### Resilience model

Infrastructure clients use a reusable `CircuitBreaker` (from `platform_sdk.resilience`) that opens after consecutive failures and recovers after a configurable timeout. Both `OpaClient` and `ToolResultCache` use this pattern, preventing cascading failures when OPA or Redis is temporarily unavailable.

### Caching model

There are two main cache layers:

- LiteLLM semantic cache for model responses
- tool-result caching for MCP tool outputs (Redis-backed, circuit-breaker protected)

This improves latency and reduces repeated work while keeping security decisions centralized.

## Testing Strategy

The repo uses three layers of testing so failures are easier to understand and debug. CI runs via four GitHub Actions workflows: `ci-unit.yml`, `ci-integration.yml`, `ci-evals.yml`, and `ci-deploy.yml`.

### Layer 1: unit tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-unit
```

Focus:

- auth and HMAC helpers
- row-filter and column-mask logic
- circuit-breaker state transitions
- cache-key behavior
- prompt loader rendering
- markdown rendering

### Layer 2: integration tests

Run with:

```bash
make dev-test-up
make test-integration
```

Focus:

- API behavior end-to-end
- OPA policy decisions
- database-backed tool behavior
- seeded local test data (45 CRM accounts, 1000 payments)

### Layer 3: evals

Run with:

```bash
make test-evals
```

Focus:

- synthesis quality
- specialist tool-calling fidelity
- hallucination and grounding checks

## Troubleshooting First Steps

If the stack is not behaving as expected:

```bash
make infra-status    # check infrastructure health
make dev-status      # check app service health
make dev-logs        # follow app logs
make infra-logs      # follow infrastructure logs
make dev-reset       # restart app services (infra untouched)
```

Useful checks:

- Confirm `.env` exists and required secrets are populated
- Confirm Docker containers are healthy
- Confirm LiteLLM can reach your model provider
- Confirm the database was seeded if you expect CRM/payments test data
